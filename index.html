				<h1>Naman Taggar</h1>
				<p class="ntdesc">
					I am an under-graduate student of <span class="hl"><b>Mathematics</b></span> at the University of Delhi, India with particular interests lying in <span class="hl"><b>algebra.</b></span> I am interested in many other things including design, typesetting, music and photography.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Projects.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The things I have worked on can be found <a href="https://github.com/zplus11" target="_blank">here.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Highlights.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I contributed as part of Organising Committee to the <i>International Conference on Mathematical Sciences and its Applications</i> (ICMSA 2024) organised by Department of Mathematics, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur (SGTB) Khalsa College, University of Delhi during 15&ndash;17 October, 2024. Over 140 delegates from India and abroad joined the conference. I also delivered a presentation entitled &ldquo;Finite Group Theory in Mathematica&rdquo; where I demonstrated the use of a Mathematica package I developed.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been editing the official magazine of SGTB Khalsa College since 2023. The annual document is over 200 pages in length and over 500 hard-copies are printed every year. Furthermore, I have also contributed to the re-curation of the college's official website by providing content and graphics. I performed an analysis of marks and attendance in the college using R, and talked about it in <a href="pages/posts/Attendance-Marks.html">this blog post.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					I have joined numerous workshops including 2 national workshops, on topics varying from programming with Python to numerical optimisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Skills &amp; Languages.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak English and Hindi. I know Mathematica, Python (base, numpy, pandas), R (base, dyplr, ggplot2), and a little bit of Javascript. I am well-experienced with LaTeX, and familiar with Inkscape (vector graphics editing), HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
